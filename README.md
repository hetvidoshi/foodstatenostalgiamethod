This repository contains scripts to standardize your images (i.e., stimuli). 

In our study, we elicited food nostalgia using images of foods. 

We collected images of Indian and American foods. Then, we standardized their size and brightness and contrast. We measured texture, luminance, saturation, hue, and greyscale (or mean RGB values). We compared the two groups for each measured property to calculate group-level differences. 

To replicate, or apply, our method, begin by reading the "Files_Description.docx".
